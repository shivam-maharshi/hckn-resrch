Given below is a list of projects in this repository.

### [1. Cache Web Service] (https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/hckn-resrch/tree/master/cache-ws)
This project contains web services that provides HTTP PUT request body in-memory caching & persistence on file system. Currently two type of web services are available in two languages:<br><br>
<dl>
<dt> a. PHP - Implemented in PHP, this web service uses Apache web server or NGNIX to run. </dt>
<dt> b. Python - Implemented in Python, this web service is capable of using Apache web server or can start its own light weight Flask server. </dt>
</dl>

### [2. MediaWiki Benchmark] (https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/hckn-resrch/tree/master/mw-benchmark) 
This project contains all the code and configurations to install, optimize and benchmark a Wikipedia server with realistic workload. Wikipedia, empowered by MediaWiki, can be used to assess and compare the performance of different:
<dl>
<dt> a. Web Servers - Apache, LightHTTP, NGNIX, etc. </dt>
<dd> b. Web Server Modules  - Apache MPM, Preform, Event, etc. </dd>
<dd> c. Databases - MySQL, Postgress, TSQL, SQLLite, etc. </dd>
<dd> d. Caches - Accel, Memcached, Redis, etc. </dd>
<dd> e. Archiving - SiteStory, Cache Based Archiving, etc. </dd>
</dl>
### [3. MediaWiki Docker] (https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/hckn-resrch/tree/master/mw-docker)

### [4. MediaWiki Import] (https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/hckn-resrch/tree/master/mw-import)
